    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team); // Returns ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Jock'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team); // Returns ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Jock'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Jock']

    // now here is the problem! Oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice(); // If no arguments are passed, slice will return the entire array (therefore making a copy).

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players); // Will concat all the elements in players array, straight into the new team3 array.

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'Jock Dalby',
      age: 30
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person) // Returns { name: 'Jock Dalby', age: 30, number: 99}

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

    console.log(captain2, person); // Returns { name: 'Jock Dalby', age: 12, number: 99}, { name: 'Jock Dalby', age: 30}

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const Jock = {
      name: 'Jock',
      age: 30,
      social: {
        twitter: 'jockDalby',
        facebook: 'Jock Dalby'
      }
    }

    console.log(Jock);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, Jock)

    dev.name = 'Jonathan' // Only changes dev Object

    dev.social.twitter = 'testing' // Changes both dev and Jock Objects twitter name to 'testing'
